For n = 1,
1 = (1+1)! - 1
1 = 1.
 $$\therefore P_1 \text{ is true}$$
 $$\text{Assume }P_k \text{ is true.}$$
 $$P_k = (k+1)! - 1$$$$P_{k+1} = P_{k} + (k+1) * (k+1)!$$$$ P_{k+1} = (k+1)! - 1 + (k+1) * (k+1)!$$$$P_{k+1} = (k+2)(k+1)! - 1$$$$P_{k+1} = (k+2)! - 1$$$$\therefore P_{k+1} \text{ is true when }P_k\text{ is true.}$$
