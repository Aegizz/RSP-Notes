#Definition
#### Counter-example is an instance of an algorithm's input that yields an incorrect output.

#### Good counter examples have two properties, verifiability and simplicity.

A counter example with good verifiability will, calculate what the algorithm will answer for that instance, display a better answer so as to prove the algorithm did not find it.

A counter example with good simplicity will remove all unnecessary details boiled away. it will clearly demonstrate why the algorithm failed. 

- Think small
- Think exhaustively
- Hunt for weaknesses
- Go for a tie
- Seek extremes
