#Heuristic 
#JobSelection 
#Example 

$$\displaylines{\text{Accept the earliest starting job j from I which does not overlap my} \\ \text{previously accepted job, and repeat until no more such jobs remain.}}$$

Not efficient as jobs at the start that are long may block us from taking two short jobs.
